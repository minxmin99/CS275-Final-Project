** Repository of CS 275 Final Project in Developing Webapp **

A walkthrough of what I did:
	- Have visual studio code (not Visual Studio which is heavier) 
	- Install packages Ionic 4 Snippet on VS Code
	- Make sure npm install ionic as well (it should install all dependencies for Ionic)
	- The main development should initially begin in src/app
	- I picked the tabbed template to with 3 tabs to begin with
		+ Profile
		+ Map
		+ Achievement
		(But this could change later)
