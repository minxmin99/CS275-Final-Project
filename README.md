***Repository of CS 275 Final Project in Developing Webapp***

A walkthrough of what I did:
	- Have visual studio code (not Visual Studio which is heavier) 
	- Install packages Ionic 4 Snippet on VS Code
	- Type npm init in the fog-off directory  
	- Make sure npm install ionic as well (it should install all dependencies for Ionic)
	- The main development should initially begin in src/app
	- I picked the tabbed template to with 3 tabs to begin with
		+ Profile
		+ Map
		+ Achievement
		(But this could change later)
		
	
To start the app on localhost:8100
	- On terminal, go inside fog-off directory and type ionic serve
	- Should things go fine, after a couple seconds, your default browser will automatically open a new tab with the app running
